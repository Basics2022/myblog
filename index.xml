<p>This post tries to answer a narrow <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/864252/fixed-vs-free-ends-in-1d-standing-waves">question</a> I’ve found on Physics SE, mainly about some doubts (s)he has about standing waves and response to harmonic forcing arising from the YouTube video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=Ewe45KtT3trKdzPS&amp;v=-gr7KmTOrx0&amp;feature=youtu.be">Standing Waves Parti I: Demonstration</a>, by <a href="James Dann, Ph.D">James Dann, Ph.D</a>.</p>

<p>Hello, blog!</p>
<p>This is just the first post of the <strong>basics blog</strong>, exploiting Quarto. Could it be the answer to the need for a simple tool, providing similar experience to Jupyter Books with minimal fancy tools for blogging, like tags, automatic layout of the main page (e.g.&nbsp;with latest post), built with .md and .ipynb, to be publicly hosted on GitHub, and allowing comments with the smallest amount of pain as possible? I’ll find out.</p>
<p>I’ve come across Quarto just this morning, through some nice examples <a href="https://bitsofanalytics.org/">Mark Isken, Bits of Abalytics</a>, who looks like having some experience with blogging and moved to Quarto after using several other platforms: his blog looks good and clean, it looks like he has my same needs, he looks quite satisfied with Quarto and he’s explaining why in details in his post <a href="https://bitsofanalytics.org/posts/port-to-quarto/">Firts impressions of blogging with Quarto</a>, written in 2023. There are no later posts about porting, while the last post came out only few days ago: it looks like the blog is alive and he keeps using Quarto. So, why shouldn’t I trust him?</p>
