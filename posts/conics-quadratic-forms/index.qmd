**Introduction.**

**Geometry.** Different definitions:

- as plane sections of a conical surface  
- in terms of eccentricity  
- in terms of distances from the foci  

**Analytical geometry and algebra.** If the two independent variables $x$, $y$ represent the Cartesian coordinates of points in the plane, the second-degree polynomial equation

$$
A x^2 + B x y + C y^2 + D x + E y + F = 0 \ ,
$$

when it admits real solutions, defines the set of points of a regular or degenerate conic section, see [Math:Analytic Geometry:Conics and Quadratic Forms](https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks-math-miscellanea-hs/ch/analytic_geometry/analytic_geometry_2d/conics-and-quadratic-forms.html).

**Physics.**

- Gravitation, trajectories in the two-body problem, see [Physics:Mechanics:Dynamics:Central motions](https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks-physics-hs/ch/mechanics/dynamics-central.html)

- Trajectories of two electric charges, as in the  
  [Physics:XX Century Physics:Rutherford–Geiger–Marsden scattering experiment](https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks-physics-hs/ch/modern/experiments-matter.html#modello-atomico-di-rutherford-geiger-mardsen), through which the Rutherford atomic model was formulated. This model predicts that the atom is mostly empty space with a positively charged nucleus. The three scientists bombarded a thin gold foil with positively charged \(\alpha\) particles and observed a scattering pattern compatible with hyperbolic trajectories—those followed by a charged particle under the electric field generated by another point charge of the same sign, kept at rest.

**Introduction.**

**Geometria.** Diverse definizioni:

- come sezioni piane di una superficie conica
- in termini di eccentricità
- in termini di distanze dai fuochi

**Geometria analitica e algebra.** Se le due variabili indipendenti $x$, $y$ indicano le due coordinate cartesiane per identificare i punti di un piano, l'equazione polinomiale di secondo grado 

$$A x^2 + B xy + C y^2 + D x + E + F = 0 \ ,$$

quando ammette soluzioni reali, definisce i punti di una sezione conica regolare o degenere.

**Fisica.**

- Gravitazione, traiettorie nel problema dei due corpi [Fisica:meccanica:dimanica:moti centrali](https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks-physics-hs/ch/mechanics/dynamics-central.html)
- Traiettoria di due cariche elettrice, come nell'[esperimento di scattering di Rutherford-Geiger-Mardsen](https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks-physics-hs/ch/modern/experiments-matter.html#modello-atomico-di-rutherford-geiger-mardsen), grazie al quale è stato formulato il modello atomico di Rutherford, che prevede che l'atomo sia principalmente vuoto di materia e con un nucleo positivo: i tre scienziati bombardarono una sottile lamina d'oro con delle particelle $\alpha$ &mdash; di carica positiva &mdash; e ottennero uno scattering compatibile con traiettorie iperboliche, traiettorie seguite da una particella di carica elettrica soggetta al campo elettrico generato da un'altra carica puntiforme di carica concorde e mantenuta in quiete.

Conic sections are among the first curves where algebra and geometry truly start to speak the same language. On the surface, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas look like simple shapes—often introduced early in mathematics education as loci or as intersections of a plane with a cone. Yet, behind these familiar figures lies a remarkably rich structure that makes conics an ideal playground for analytical geometry and linear algebra.

From a mathematical point of view, conics offer a natural context in which to train essential tools: coordinate changes, quadratic forms, diagonalization, eigenvalues, and invariants. Starting from a single second-degree equation in two variables, one can uncover an entire taxonomy of curves through systematic algebraic manipulation. This process is not just a technical exercise—it reveals how geometry is encoded in algebra, and how different equations can describe the same geometric object once the right coordinates are chosen.

Beyond their algebraic elegance, conic sections possess striking geometric properties. Reflection laws of ellipses and parabolas, focal definitions, and symmetry principles give these curves a special role in optics, mechanics, and geometry. These properties are not mathematical curiosities: they explain why parabolic mirrors focus light, why whispering galleries work, and why certain trajectories arise naturally in physical systems.

Conics also appear everywhere in science and engineering. Planetary orbits in gravitational fields are ellipses, escape trajectories are parabolas or hyperbolas, and the paths of particles under central forces often reduce to conic sections. Even repulsive interactions, such as those between like electric charges, lead naturally to hyperbolic motion. Understanding conics, therefore, means understanding a common geometric language shared across physics, astronomy, and engineering.

The main goal of this post is to take a comprehensive look at conic sections starting from the most general quadratic equation in two variables. Rather than focusing only on the “classical” non-degenerate cases, we will systematically explore all possibilities: regular conics, degenerate cases (such as pairs of lines or a single point), and even equations that correspond to no real curve at all. This complete classification is rarely presented in detail, yet it is precisely where algebra, geometry, and interpretation come together most clearly. In that sense, conics are not just a basic topic—they are a perfect example of how much depth can be hidden inside simple equations.
