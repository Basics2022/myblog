## Blogging with Quarto
Basics blog with Quarto.

Why Quarto? At a first impression, it looks good and with all the features I need, as described by Mark Isken on its blog [Bits of Analytics](https://bitsofanalytics.org/posts/port-to-quarto/).

Hoping that this will feel like a clean extension of a Jupyter Book with fancy tools blog at the minimum pain, like tags and automatic layout of the main page with latest posts. That's all I need here: just a tool blog made with .md and .ipynb, to be publicly hosted on GitHub, allowing comments.

Here I'll list some useful comments and references
